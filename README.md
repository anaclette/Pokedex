# Pokedex app [WIP]

This is a Pokedex built with React Native that displays data fetched from [Poke API](https://pokeapi.co/). The user can navigate through the pokedex where they'll find 1200 pokemons, find specific ones through the Search tab, check out each Pokemon's full set of qualities, and even save their favourites which are then stored in the favourites tab.
It is an app meant for the pokemon devoted little ones and growunps as well to dig into it and master their knowledge on a Pokemon battle and/or for personal amusement.
